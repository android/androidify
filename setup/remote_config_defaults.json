Explicitly name the facial hair style if known. If the subject does not have facial hair, describe it as no facial hair.\n- Headwear (only if any exists): If the subject is wearing headwear, identify the type (e.g., baseball cap, fedora, beanie), color, and material. Describe any visually distinct details such as patterns (e.g., plaid, stripes, floral), textures (e.g., knit, leather, straw), or embellishments (e.g., embroidery, sequins, ribbons). Specify its position on the head (e.g., tilted back, covering the ears). Include the name of the headwear if possible.\n- Clothing: Provide a thorough description of the clothing worn on the subject's top and bottom. For each garment, detail the style (e.g., t-shirt, blouse, jeans, skirt), colors (including any gradients or color blocking), materials (e.g., cotton, silk, denim), patterns (e.g., polka dots, floral, paisley, geometric), embellishments (e.g., buttons, zippers, lace), and fit (e.g., tight, loose, tailored).

Be visually specific about any details such as laces (color, type of lacing), buckles (shape, material), or straps (number, placement).\n- Accessories: Describe any accessories worn by the subject, including jewelry (e.g., necklace, earrings, rings - specify material, color, and any notable features), hats (if not already described as headwear - reiterate key details), glasses (e.g., frame shape, color, lens type), watches (e.g., strap material, face color), and any other visible adornments (e.g., scarves, belts - describe color, material, and how they are worn). Detail the color, placement, position, and arrangement of each accessory on the subject.\n- Props or items: Describe any props or items the subject is holding or interacting with. This includes electronic devices (e.g., smartphone - color, screen details; laptop - color, open or closed), food or drinks (e.g., coffee cup - color, material; apple - color, size), sporting equipment (e.g., basketball - color, texture; tennis racket - color, grip details), or any other objects held in the hands, placed on the body (e.g., a backpack - color, material, details), or positioned next to the subject in a way that suggests interaction (e.g., a book lying open). For each item, describe its color, material, and any significant details. Prefer to be held on the hand if possible. Do not include furniture. Furniture is not considered a prop or item.\n- Any other special attributes or characteristics of the subject's body and style that provide further detail\n\n* If the person's clothing, accessories or items include photorealistic depictions of humans or animals, describe them as having a cartoon style.\n* If the person's clothing, accessories or items include artistic renderings, graphical depictions, or elaborate pictures describe them as having a cartoon style, portrayed in a simple manner.\n* Use color names that accurately reflect human visual perception and are commonly understood by image generation models.\n* DO NOT describe the background or setting that is behind or around the subject. Focus only on describing the main person in the foreground and items it is interacting with. If there is more than one person in the image, ALWAYS choose only the most prominent person in the foreground.\n* Do not describe the skin color of the subject in the image.\n* Do not infer ethnicity.\n* Do not infer gender. The description should always include gender neutral language when referring to the subject, such as \"it\" or \"the figure\".\n* Do not describe any permanent markings on the skin such as tattoos, scars, birthmarks, skin discolorations, or notable moles. It is only permissible to describe temporary paint or markings on the skin that are obviously part of a costume or cultural dress.\n* Do not describe any facial expressions. However, describing the subject's general mood is helpful.\n* DO NOT describe parts of the face such as the nose, mouth, lips, teeth, or tongue. The final rendered figure should not have these body parts.\n* Do not describe any body piercings such as nose piercings or naval piercings. Only describing earrings is permissible.\n* Do not describe nails, nail polish, or rings if present on the subject's fingers or toes. Avoid including the words \"fingers\" or \"toes\" in your description.\n* Do not describe any branded logos or icons or emblems that may be included in the image or as part of the subject.\n* DO NOT describe any text, slogans, typography or items that depict alphanumeric symbols that may be found in the image. Instead, describe it as a generic placeholder and blur it.\n* Do not describe any blood or gore or open wounds, if they are present on the subject.\n* Do not describe the pose that the subject is in, such as sitting, standing, dancing, or waving. Only describe what the subject looks like. The subject should always be described in a standing position facing forward, unless the subject is in a wheelchair or using a walking aid that may require its body to adapt to that.\n* Do not include any adult substances inappropriate for children, nor any actions directly related to their use. Specifically exclude cigarettes, drugs, drug paraphernalia, alcoholic beverages, and similar items, as well as activities such as smoking, injecting, drinking alcohol, or any other actions involving these substances.\n* If the subject is holding any weapon that suggests violence, only describe it if it is obviously a toy, a fake prop that won't actually cause harm, or is used in common sports. For example, do not ever describe a realistic gun, but it is permissible if the image shows a subject holding a plastic water squirt gun. Similarly, if the image shows the subject holding a baseball bat, that is permissible because it is primarily used in sports.\n* ID badges or any accessories or items that include a person's face MUST be stated together with the phrase \"that has no image.\" For example, \"ID badge that has no image,\" etc.\n\n\n* Your description should start with a high level overview of the new image starting with style. Then describe details of the subject, accessories and context with strong style influence. Then finish with details about the style.\n* Do not use the word \"Subject\" in description.\n* Never say \"the image\".\n* Never use the suffix \"-esque\" or \"-style\".\n* Do not say rendered, rendering, or digital.\n* Only respond with new image description as a paragraph."
