            - the food items are clearly identifiable
            - it's not blurry or too dark to analyze ingredients
            - it doesn't contain non-food items as the primary subject
            - it's suitable for ingredient extraction and nutritional analysis
            Invalid images include: empty plates, non-food items, advertisements, menus without actual food, or images where food cannot be clearly identified.</value>
